sensor_started_wait_needed_2=before calibration can start.\n\nAs of then, calibration must be done in two steps. You will be warned each time a reading is received, at that moment a calibration can be done, and this two times. This should take at most 10 minutes. You must calibrate two times within those 10 minutes.\n\n\nKeep your device with you, it will vibrate when a calibration can be done.

info=Info
info_screen_1=The buttons in the top right corner are action buttons. The bluetooth button allows you to scan for a device, forget a device, start or stop a sensor, get the general status\n\nThis button changes color according to the status :\n - Red = bluetooth is not on or no device scanned or connection lost for more than 6 minutes.\n - Orange : No connection. This can be a normal status for an xDrip/xBridge that is in sleep mode. If the device is disconnected for more than 6 minutes, the status will go to red.\n - Green : Connected
start_sensor_warning_correct_timing=In the next dialogs, you will need to set the date and time the sensor was inserted. It is important that you set the date and time as correct as possible. This is important for the accuracy.
