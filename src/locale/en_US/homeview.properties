connected_to_peripheral_device_id_stored=Connected to xdrip/xBridge/LimiTTer. Device details will be stored in database. Future attempts will only use this device to connect to.\n\nTo use another device, select first "Forget xDrip/xBridge/LimiTTer"
info=Info
info_screen_1=The buttons in the top right corner are action buttons. The bluetooth button allows you to scan for a device, forget a device, start or stop a sensor, get the general status\n\nThis button changes color according to the status :\n - Red = bluetooth is not on or no device scanned or connection lost for more than 6 minutes.\n - Orange : No connection. This can be a normal status for an xDrip/xBridge that is in sleep mode. If the device is disconnected for more than 6 minutes, the status will go to red.\n - Green : Connected
